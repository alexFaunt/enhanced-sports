// Preact-compat is not working server side
// It works when i import it, but when react-router imports it, it's ignored.
// see .babelrc for the shim. It works with webpack on front end so might be okay.

// CSS doesn't work server side - trying to use webpack laoders with babel to make it load.

// Post css doesnt WORK
