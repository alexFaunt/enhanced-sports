## Techs
preact
redux
react-router 4
css modules
babel
webpack
koa

## Notes
Using aliasing to set react to preact-compat on node rather than webpack the server
using webpack to do the same for the bundle

To get css modules importing on server side need to use webpack loaders for node



## TODOS
Bug where dom order is not respected

Post css doesnt WORK because of webpack apparently.???

minify CSS in prod
minify HTML in prod
Webpack tree shaking

HTML streaming

Add jest tests
Maybe sagas or Loop?
